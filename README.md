# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

## Project Description
This project performs an in-depth sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews. The goal is to classify the reviews as positive or negative using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning models. 

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Load and clean the dataset, remove noise, and convert text to numerical data using TF-IDF.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze and visualize the distribution of sentiments, common words, and create word clouds.
3. **Model Training:** Split data into training and testing sets. Train multiple models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using GridSearchCV for better performance.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Visualize performance metrics.
7. **Visualization:** Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing key steps and results.
